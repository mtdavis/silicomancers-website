Margaret is an apprentice glassmaker in her family’s shop, unsure about the future expected of her.

Berzelius is an aging man of science on the royal court, ridiculed for his obsession with
the long-lost secrets of creating magical pearls.

A science experiment brings them together. Then a near-invincible enemy attacks the walled city they call home…

The defending troops repel the initial onslaught, but now the city is under siege.
The townspeople are on edge, and food is running low.

Can Margaret and Berzelius solve the pearls’ mysteries in time to muster a counterattack?
